## How can we start codigin with Qt and qmake?
To generate a .pro file for your project, you can use the qmake -project command in the terminal4. This command will generate a .pro file in the current directory based on the source files it finds.

Once you have a .pro file, you can use qmake to generate a Makefile for your project, and then use make to build your project. This way, you donâ€™t need to manually specify the path to your Qt installation in your Makefile.

Here are the commands you would use:
```bash
qmake -project
qmake
make
```
